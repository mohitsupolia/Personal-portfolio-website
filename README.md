## Features.
A personal portfolio is like an online resume where you show off your skills and work. You can introduce yourself, share projects you've done, and list your talents. 
It's important to make it easy for people to contact you and to make it look nice on phones and computers. 
You can also include nice things people have said about your work and maybe even some of your own writing. It's like your own little corner of the internet to show the world what you can do!!!
